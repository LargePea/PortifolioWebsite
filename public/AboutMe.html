        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Hello, I am Ralph! I am a junior gameplay and tools programmer with strong fluency in C#. 
            I am currently in the midst of self studying C++.
            I am a VFS graduate of the Game Design program and have done many team game projects. 
            My time at VFS has allowed me to strengthen my communication skills, which allows me to work well in teams.
            I have a passion to always learn and become a developer everyday.
            But besides game development I also enjoy cooking, baking, anime, and many other things.</p>

        <h4>In The Beginning...</h4>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ralph and I am a junior gameplay and tools programmer who is trying to break into the industry! 
            I have done a few projects ranging from terminal console games to website games and even fully fledged games using Unity!
            My passion for developing video games developed when I was senior year in highschool, when 
            I joined a programming class and found developing games to be extremely fufilling and decided to pursue this careerer path.
            Over the summer of that year I began learning how to code in C#, how to use Unity and applied to VFS to chase after my passion.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div> <br>
        <h4>My Time at VFS...</h4>
        <p>
            My time at Vancouver Film School has allowed me to learn how to not only develop games, but also how to get along with people and made many friends.
            Studying at VFS has been extremely hectic, forcing me to quickly develop better time management skills to get all my projects and tasks done on time.
            And speaking of projects I did quite a few of them and made a couple of notable ones, which you can find under the "Projects" tab. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These projects have drastically improved my communication skills as I have to constantly communicate with my team members to deliver a cohesive and well polished product.
            Through our team post mortems I've picked up best practices when it comes to developing and integrating gameplay features to prevent source control overwrites and game-breaking bugs.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div> <br>
        <h4>To Finish...</h4>
        <p>
            Now what does this all say about me? I am fast and a self-motivated learner who can quickly adapt to any situation at hand and can work well with people. 
            Even though I have minimal professional experience, what I've learned from working on personal games will allow me to easliy and quickly integrate into any team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides creating video games, I also enjoy baking, cooking, anime, drawing, animating, excersising, and, of course, playing video games.
        </p>
